    **Ingredients**


    * 600g bread flour

    * One packet of instant yeast. 7 grams.

    * 7-10 grams of fine salt e.g table salt.

    * 360 grams warm water OR 420 grams. If you use the first amount it’ll give
    you a 60% hydration dough, The second quantity 70%. 70% is harder to work
    with but dries out less in the oven. Your decision. I use 70%.

    * Between 15g-30g vegetable oil (helps dry out less and assists with
    browning take your pick on the amount you can skip it entirely too if that’s
    your thing)

    * 1 or 2 tablespoons of sugar (helps with browning and is a nice balance to
    the yeast and salt flavouring gives the bread a pretzel bagel type flavour.
    You can again omit this entirely if that’s your thing. &nbsp;

    This is a no kneading dough recipe that I’ve perfected which doesn’t require
    a bulky stand mixer or any machines.&nbsp;


    If you own a stand mixer you can just use the usual methods and can knock
    this whole thing out in much less time. &nbsp;Don’t try and be a hero and
    knead manually, your arms will tire out before you produce 20% of the
    desired amount of gluten.&nbsp;


    The dough takes 5 minutes to put together. Mix the below ingredients
    together in any order (although flour first don’t be a weirdo)


    Ingredients


    Like most people I put this dough together at night so I can eat bread the
    next day.&nbsp;


    If you have work the next day and won’t be able to make the bread until the
    next evening put your dough mixture in the fridge to slow rise.&nbsp;<br>So
    if you put the dough together at 6pm put it in your fridge and take it out
    the next evening at 6pm. A 24 hour slow rise produces a great taste.


    If you want to cook the bread the morning you wake up and you work from home
    or it’s a weekend you can instead let it fast rise overnight for 12 hours in
    a bowl covered with a towel or plate somewhere relatively warm like a turned
    off microwave or turned off oven.&nbsp;


    Whichever method you chose fast or slow rise your dough should have doubled
    in size and be full of bubbles from the co2 created. This is bon.&nbsp;


    Form it into a ball shape. Dust with extra flour if your dough is wet or
    sticky and hard to work with.&nbsp;<br>Divide the dough into 8 pieces for
    rolls the size of the above post or into 4 pieces for much larger rolls.
    &nbsp;&nbsp;


    Let them rest until they expand and then one by one put them into a pot of
    boiling water and 80grams or so of baking powder for 30 seconds to to a
    minute. Flipping so both sides are nicely saturated.


    The alkaline solution in the baking soda water is what gives the browning
    that you expect from pretzels. Drain them put on a tray lined with non stick
    baking paper. Add toppings to the rolls at this point.


    Bake in the oven at 200-220 for 20 mins maybe more maybe less depending on
    your oven.
