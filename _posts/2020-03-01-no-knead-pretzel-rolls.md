    **Ingredients**


    * 600g bread flour

    * One packet of instant yeast. 7 grams.

    * 7-10 grams of fine salt e.g table salt.

    * 360 grams warm water OR 420 grams. If you use the first amount it’ll give
    you a 60% hydration dough, The second quantity 70%. 70% is harder to work
    with but dries out less in the oven. Your decision. I use 70%.

    * Between 15g-30g vegetable oil (helps dry out less and assists with
    browning take your pick on the amount you can skip it entirely too if that’s
    your thing)

    * 1 or 2 tablespoons of sugar (helps with browning and is a nice balance to
    the yeast and salt flavouring gives the bread a pretzel bagel type flavour.
    You can again omit this entirely if that’s your thing. &nbsp;

    # This is a no kneading dough recipe


    **I've adjusted and perfected it to my tastes the great thing about this
    recipe is you don't need a bulky stand mixer or to spend ages kneading dough
    by hand, or any equipment, all you need is time.**


    > If you own a stand mixer you can still use the ingredient quantities
    posted but ignore all the steps below.


    > Don't be that person that tries to make bread by kneading by hand. Your
    arms will want to fall off before you even get close to forming enough
    gluten.<br>&nbsp;


    Mix the ingredients together in any order (although flour first don’t be a
    weirdo)


    The dough takes 3 minutes to put together into a rough ball shape.&nbsp;


    I'd suggest preparing your dough at night.


    You have two options a slow rise or a fast rise depending on your life
    schedule.


    A fast rise. This means leaving your dough mixture covered for 12 hours or
    so covered at room temperature. Which means you can make this in the evening
    and have dough ready to go the next morning.


    A slow rise. If you don't work from home or its not a weekend this is the
    option that'll work best for most people. After you've mixed the ingredients
    in a bowl into a lose ball place the dough in the fridge covered for 24-48
    hours.


    Whichever rise you went with, once risen form your dough into a ball shape
    again (itll lose its shape when it rose the first time)


    &nbsp;Dust with extra flour if your dough is wet or sticky and hard to work
    with.&nbsp;<br>Divide the dough into 8 pieces for rolls the size of the
    above post or into 4 pieces for much larger rolls. &nbsp;&nbsp;


    Let each dough ball rest until they expand and then one by one put them into
    a pot of boiling water and 80 grams or so of baking powder for 30 seconds to
    to a minute. Flipping so both sides are nicely saturated.


    The alkaline solution in the baking soda water is what gives the browning
    that you expect from pretzels. Drain them put on a tray lined with non stick
    baking paper. Add toppings to the rolls at this point.


    Bake in the oven at 200-220 for 20 mins maybe more maybe less depending on
    your oven.
