  directions_markdown: "> The fries require a longer preparation time than the tofu if you're choosing to cook both or you can just use frozen chips I guess or no chips at all. You're the master of your own destiny.\n\n**Fries**\n\n1. Peel each of your potatoes and cut into fry sized pieces\n2. Place each cut fry into a bowl of cold water as you go to stop them from discoloring due to oxidation from the air&nbsp;\n3. Once you've cut up all the potatoes fill up the bowl of fries with more cold water and empty it a few times. The goal here is to rinse off as much starch from the fries as possible. If you cook rice regularly you're already familiar with this step.\n4. Place the fries in the fridge in a bowl of clean cold salted water for 2 hours. Starch is the enemy here. The rinsing and the 2 hour soak will remove the bulk of the starch on the outside and inside the chips. **If you skip this step your fries will be bad. All good fries start life as a low starch potato. \U0001F64F**\n5. Drain the fries in a colander or sieve and pat dry. **Oil and water aren't friends.&nbsp;**\n\n6. &nbsp;Heat oil in a saucepan ready to fry. Add enough oil to cover your fries. If you have a thermometer you want your oil at 180 Celsius. If like me you don't own a thermometer you can place a wooden skewer or wooden spoon into the oil, if little bubbles start to form around the wooden object your oil its hot enough.&nbsp;\n\n7. Fry until golden brown\n\n8. Remove shake off any excess oil and apply liberally with salt and any seasoning of choice.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Tofu**\n\n1. Press your tofu. Think its pressed enough? press it some more.\n2. Marinade your tofu in a bowl or container of vegan chicken flavoured instant gravy e.g bisto for at least 30 minutes. **This is important** as it gives a chicken flavour and also allows the breading to stick to the tofu, in place of using an egg.\n3. Place tofu in blender with 1-2 tablespoons of cornflour and pulse until tofu has the consistency of a burger patty texture<br><br>&nbsp;***Why blend the tofu? 2 reasons. One is that you can now form the tofu into any shape your heart desires. Two the uneven shape and texture is how you get that lovely craggly texture where the flour is packed into the little nooks of the tofu. It also seems to hold the breading better than breading a standard square piece of tofu.&nbsp;***<br>&nbsp;\n4. In a suitably sized tray add fall purpose flour and your seasonings of choice and combine thoroughly\n5. Form your tofu one piece at a time into whichever shape you desire, in this case strips alternatively this same recipe applies if you want to make chicken tofu burgers, just make them burger shaped.\n6. Coat each shaped piece of tofu in your flour mixture and set each piece aside until you've coated all the pieces.&nbsp;\n7. Heat oil in a saucepan large enough to accommodate several tofu pieces at a time. If you have a thermometer you want your oil at 180 Celsius. If like me you don't own a thermometer you can place a wooden skewer or wooden spoon into the oil, if little bubbles start to form around your wooden object then the oil its hot enough.&nbsp; Alternatively you can drop a small piece of battered tofu in to gauge the temperature. If your oil is too hot your tofu will taste greasy and nasty.&nbsp; Be mindful also that the &nbsp;temperature of your oil will drop if you add too many pieces at once.\n8. As we're cooking plant based we don't have to worry about the tofu being raw or under cooked so cook your pieces until they are golden, remember your tofu will continue to darken outside of the pan due to the residual heat.\n9. If you want your tofu chicken extra crispy you can do a shorter first fry and then put the pieces back in for a second shorter fry at a slightly higher temperature.\n\n**Any questions message me.&nbsp;**\n\n**\\- James&nbsp;**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;"
