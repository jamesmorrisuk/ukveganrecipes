    * Vegetable Oil

    * Onions

    * Half block of cream coconut or 1 can of full-fat coconut milk

    * &nbsp;1 can of plum tomatoes or chopped if you cannot find plum.

    * 1 heaped tablespoon Mixed madras curry powder

    * 1 heaped teaspoon Garam masala powder

    * 2 heaped teaspoons Tikka paste

    * 1-2 Tablespoons of sugar

    * &nbsp;2-3 tablespoons Desiccated coconut (optional)

    * 3 tablespoons Almonds (IMPORTANT) (I use ground almonds, important for a
    smooth texture if you want to replicate your local takeaway)

    * 1-2 tablespoons Ginger garlic paste homemade or shop-bought, or use
    chopped fresh garlic and ginger alternatively but not recommended use garlic
    powder and ginger powder. Ive never tried using powder it could taste really
    bad, try it and let me know?

    * A few squirts of Lemon juice or vinegar.


    * Vegetables of choice and as many chilies as your heart desires

      > Optional: food coloring powder or paprika or beetroot extract if you’re not about that food coloring life.

    1. Add 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil (not olive oil, not coconut oil it’ll
    fuck everything up) in a pan with your gas at medium.<br>*Optional: Add
    mustard seeds and nigella seeds to your pan and let them begin to slowly
    fry.&nbsp;* Next add 1 HEAPED tablespoon of your mixed curry powder and 1
    heaped teaspoon of garam masala powder. Add your garlic & ginger paste to
    the hot pan. Keep frying the spices and paste off at a medium temperature
    until fragrant, if things look like they're going to start burning add a
    little water. Make sure to continually stir every 10 seconds or so to also
    prevent burning.

    2. Add finely diced or blended onions to your pan and let them sweat off for
    a little bit until they develop a bit of colour.

    3. In a blender add a can of plum tomatoes with two heaped teaspoons of
    tikka paste.

    4. Add the blended tomatoes to your frying pan with your spices. Add some
    water if things are looking dry or like they need hydration.

    5. Cook on medium-high heat until your sauce begins to reduce and the oil
    separates and rises to the top.

    6. At this point add your protein of choice Quorn or any other chicken meat
    sub of choice or even lentils also at this point add any vegetables you want
    I used bell peppers and more onions but if you want a smooth textured sauce
    like a takeaway omit the vegetables and cook them separately for a side
    dish.

    7. Add 2-3 tablespoons of desiccated coconut and 3 heaped tablespoons of
    ground almonds and 1 tablespoon of sugar into your blender with a little
    water and blitz until smooth. Add this mixture to your pan and also add a
    splash of lemon juice or vinegar (One or the other not both) to balance off
    the sugar you just added.

    8. Once it looks and smells legit add either half a block of dissolved
    creamed coconut (I dissolve it in the microwave in a bowl of water) and then
    blend it into a smooth consistency (my preferred choice) or you can use a
    can of full-fat coconut milk. Add to your pan.


    > Continue cooking until you reach your desired level of consistency and the
    dish is nice and creamy.<br>Just before the dish is cooked to your liking
    would be the time to optionally add food colouring powder or beetroot
    extract powder if you want that signature takeaway radioactive red colour.


    > As always adjust these amounts and measurements for your own personal
    taste and preference.

    >

    > Garnish with your garnish of choice. I use coriander, a drizzle of
    coconut, fresh chilies, chipotle chilli flakes, fenugreek leaf and nigella
    seeds.

    >

    > Serve with rice and naan
