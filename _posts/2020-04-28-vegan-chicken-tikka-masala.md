    * 2 heaped teaspoons Tikka paste

    * 1-2 Tablespoons of sugar

    * &nbsp;2-3 tablespoons Desiccated coconut (optional)

    * 3 tablespoons Almonds (IMPORTANT) (I use ground, important for a smooth
    texture if you want to replicate your local takeaway)

    * 1-2 tablespoons Ginger garlic paste homemade or shop-bought, or use
    chopped fresh garlic and ginger alternatively but not recommended use garlic
    powder and ginger powder. Ive never tried using powder it could taste really
    bad, try it and let me know?

    * A few squirts of Lemon juice or vinegar.

      Vegetables of choice and as many chilies as your heart desires

      Optional: food coloring powder or paprika or beetroot extract if youâ€™re not about that food coloring life.
