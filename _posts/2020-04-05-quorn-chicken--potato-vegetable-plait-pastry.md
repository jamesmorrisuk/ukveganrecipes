    1. Peel and chop a large baking potato into small bite sized cubes. Parboil
    in a boiling water.


    2. Fry a packet of Quorn vegan chunks in a pan with a small amount of oil
    and add your drain parboiled potatos. Fry both until they develop a very
    light amount of colour. Remove from pan.


    3. In that same frying pan add 2 tablespoons of your flour of choice, 3
    tablespoons of a neutral flavour oil, I used vegetable. Begin to stir the
    flour and water mixture removing as many lumps as possible, slowly add in
    600ml of soy milk whilst continually stirring. Keep stirring on a medium
    heat until the sauce begins to thicken up. Add your sauce to a blender or
    use an immersion stick blender to remove any lumps caused by the flour.


    4. Put your now lump free mixture back into the same pan and add your salt,
    black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, chives, onions and your regular
    onion of choice.&nbsp; **Save a little of this sauce for later so you can
    drizzle it onto your pastry or use it as a side sauce if you pastry filling
    ends up being dry inside.**


    5. Add your parcooked diced potato and quorn pieces to the sauce mixture.
    Mix until combined and place onto a plate to cool. You don't want your
    filling to be hot.


    6. Remove your prerolled pastry package from the fridge and allow it to sit
    at room temperature for 10 minutes before you roll it out, otherwise it'll
    stick and tear. A bad time.


    7. Add all of your filling into the centre of the pastry vertically and
    shape it into a giant rectangle/sausage shape.
