    1. Peel and chop a large baking potato into small bite sized cubes. Parboil
    in a pan of boiling water.


    2. Fry a packet of Quorn vegan chunks in a pan with a small amount of oil
    and add your drained parboiled potatos. Fry both until they develop a very
    light amount of colour. Remove from pan.


    3. In that same frying pan add 2 tablespoons of your flour of choice, 3
    tablespoons of a neutral flavour oil, I used vegetable. Begin to stir the
    flour and water mixture removing as many lumps as possible, slowly add in
    600ml of soy milk whilst continually stirring. Keep stirring on a medium
    heat until the sauce begins to thicken up. Add your sauce to a blender or
    use an immersion stick blender to remove any lumps caused by the flour.


    4. Put your now lump free mixture back into the same pan and add your salt,
    black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, chives, onions and your regular
    onion of choice.&nbsp; **Save a little of this sauce for later so you can
    drizzle it onto your pastry or use it as a side sauce if you pastry filling
    ends up being dry inside.**


    5. Add your parcooked diced potato and quorn pieces to the sauce mixture.
    Mix until combined and place onto a plate to cool. You don't want your
    filling to be hot.


    6. Remove your prerolled pastry package from the fridge and allow it to sit
    at room temperature for 10 minutes before you roll it out, otherwise it'll
    stick and tear. A bad time.


    7. Add all of your filling into the centre of the pastry vertically and
    shape it into a giant rectangle/sausage shape.

    > You can freeze the plait pastry afterwards for 30 minutes and then place
    it into a bath of boiling water with 2 tablespoons of baking soda, this
    helps browning it's what I do with my bread. BUT it's easy to mess up and
    cause your entire pie to fall apart and disintegrate. So I wouldn't advise
    you do this for your first shot. I've made a plait before and not done this
    and it came out just as great.


    ***If you skipped the optional step, and want sesame seeds or onion seeds or
    poppy seeds to stick to the top of your pastry you'll need the pastry to be
    slightly MOIST to have your seeds adhere to the pastry, so at this point you
    can brush the plait with melted vegan butter.***


    ***If you don't want any seeds ontop of your pastry then you can skip
    brushing it with vegan butter initially but you may want to add some mid way
    to assist with browning***.


    # Cooking


    1. Heat your oven to 200c and cook the plait for 20 minutes before dropping
    the temperature down to 150c for another 20 minutes of cooking. Keep an eye
    on the pastry as all ovens vary some get hotters than others. You can remove
    the pastry half way through if you'd like and brush with more vegan butter
    if you want it to brown up further.

    2. Don't leave it in too long or it'll dry out and as always food will
    continue to residually cook once you remove it from the oven anyway.

    3. Remove the pastry and let it cool slightly before you cut into it.


    4. The end.
